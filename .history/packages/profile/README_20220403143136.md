This package provides a very simple `Profile` page that allows the current user to manage their name, email address and password inside of Dasher.

## Installation

You can install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require dasher/profile
```

Optionally, you can publish the views using

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-profile-views"
```

## Usage

This package will automatically register the `Profile` page as a Livewire component, but won't automatically add it to Dasher. You should add the following line of code to your `AppServiceProvider::register()` method.

```php
Dasher::registerPages([
    \RyanChandler\DasherProfile\Pages\Profile::class
]);
```

If you visit your Dasher panel now, you'll see a new `Account` navigation group as well as a `Profile` page.

## Customising the `Profile` page

Since the package **does not** automatically add the `Profile` page to your Dasher panel, you are free to extend the page and customise it yourself.

You should first run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
php artisan filament:page Profile
```

This will create a new `App\Dasher\Pages\Profile` class in your project.

You can then update this class to extend the `RyanChandler\DasherProfile\Pages\Profile` class.

```php
namespace App\Dasher\Pages;

use RyanChandler\DasherProfile\Pages\Profile as BaseProfile;

class Profile extends BaseProfile
{
    // ...
}
```

Dasher will automatically register your new `Profile` page and you're able to customise it to your liking. You can remove the navigation group, modify the form, etc.

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
