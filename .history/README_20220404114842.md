# Laravel Dasher

This is a fork of [laravel-filament/filament](https://github.comlaravel-filament/filament)

Roadmap:

- Multiple dashboards via config: e.g. /shop, /admin, etc...
- Multiple themes starting w/ daisyui integration.
- Blast/Storybook type ui w/ webflow drag/drop form and layout builders to merge backend dev with low-code (frontend dev). Think webflow meets backend dev, drag drop just creates all the view parts in livewire, vue, or react depending on your setup.
- Vue, Livewire, and React versions.
- Marketplace for snippets/elements etc...
- Module/DDD support using custom, nwidart's laravel modules, etc.
- SaaS features and multi-tenancy.

The first part will be multiple dashboards and multi-tenancy.
